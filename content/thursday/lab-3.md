# Neuclear Reactions Rates and Core Boundary Mixing on the Seismology of Red Clump Stars

## Introduction

In this lab we will investigate the influence of core boundary mixing, neuclear
reaction rates and metallicity on the period spacing of Red Clump (RC) stars.
This lab if following this paper - [Noll et al. 2024](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2024/03/aa48276-23/aa48276-23.html).

Red clump stars are core-helium burning stars with initial masses around 0.8–2.0 $M_{\odot}$, located in a narrow region of the color-magnitude diagram
following the helium flash.

Stars in the red clump (RC) phase are burning helium in their cores after
undergoing the helium flash. These stars are of low mass and typically have
degenerate helium cores at the tip of the red giant branch. The helium ignition
lifts this degeneracy and establishes a stable helium-burning core, surrounded
by a hydrogen-burning shell.

In the following Figure you see an Hertzsprung–Russell (HR) diagram of the GALAH DR2 sample. The highlighted rectangle marks the red clump stars region, which aligns with the highest stellar number-density contours after RGB bump just below. The color scale is linear, where darker shades indicates higher stellar densities. The Figure is taken from [Kumar et al. 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-020-1139-7).

Several physical processes in red clump stars remain uncertain. A key uncertainty is **core boundary mixing (CBM)** — whether semiconvection or overshooting dominates
near the convective core edge and which mixing schemes can support the stars we later observe. Another major uncertainty involves the nuclear reaction rates during helium burning.
The nuclear reaction rates are temperature dependent and different rates can produce a different internal stellar structure.

Asteroseismology enables us to study the internal structure of these stars through their oscillation modes. In particular, mixed modes—which behave like gravity modes in the core and pressure modes in the envelope—are highly sensitive to the structure near the convective core boundary. The asymptotic period spacing ($\Delta \Pi$) of dipole mixed modes serves as a probe of the size and composition gradient in the helium-burning core. Hence, the period spacing in RC stars as a result from different physical prescriptions in MESA gives us theoretical predictions to compare with observations and constrain their stellar structure.

**Maxilab1**: We will learn about different mixing schemes and test their affect on the period spacing $(\Delta \Pi)$ in the core He burning phase.

**Maxilab2**: We will test how different nuclear reaction rates influence the period spacing $\Delta \Pi$ in the core He burning phase.

**Warning!** These MESA labs have been built in low time and spatial resolution (including some missing physics, like using the most basic nuclear network net and no mass loss) so the students will be able to get results within a few minutes.
